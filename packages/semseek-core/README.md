> More than typesetting

TeX and its variants are good for typesetting.
But typesetting is not enough.
More meaningful expressions are required.

## Features

- Inspectible - read definition from symbol
- Animatable - erase, group, or something special

## Concepts

```semseek
use math;

f(x) = x^2
```

```semseek
use chem;

H_2 O -> H^+ + OH^-
```
